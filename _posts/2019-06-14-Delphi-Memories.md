When I was attending my high school lessons, learning some programming was not so common, yet
a computer magazine shipped with a *free* version of **Borland Delphi**, free because outdated
(was for Windows 3.1, and it was alread 1998).

I self learned what I can now define the *worst* programming language ever (Object Pascal), but
with what I can now define the **best** RAD studio ever!

Here one of my masterpieces:

I'm quite proud of the look and feel, if compared with the standard things at the time ^_^

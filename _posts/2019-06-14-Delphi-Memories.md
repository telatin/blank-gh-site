When I was attending my high school lessons, learning some programming was not so common, yet
a computer magazine shipped with a *free* version of **Borland Delphi**, free because outdated
(was for Windows 3.1, and it was alread 1998).

I self learned what I can now define the *worst* programming language ever (Object Pascal), but
with what I can now define the **best** RAD studio ever!

Here one of my masterpieces:

I'm quite proud of the look and feel, if compared with the standard things at the time ^_^! It can be
[downloaded](https://github.com/telatin/telatin.github.io/releases/download/2020/gifplus3.exe) for the braves.

Has that experience been useful somehow? Well, for my very first bioinformatics project (2004) I needed to scrape an online database, and... **Delphi** came to the rescue:

(Every other part of my batchelor project has been written in Perl :heart_eyes:)

A totally different story was SmartPad: *multiple document interface* ([MDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_document_interface)) was at that time
too hard for me to manage and so the result was a useless WordPad clone:

Didn't have enough?

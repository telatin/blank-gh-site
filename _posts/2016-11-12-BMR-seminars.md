The company I work for, _BMR Genomics_,  organised a "**NGS training tour**"
to disseminate the core concepts of library preparation and bioinformatics
analysis on four applications:

- RNA-Seq for gene expression analysis
- 16S analysis to describe microbial communities
- Targeted resequencing of human genes
- _De novo_ assembly of small genomes

I had the opportunity to present these four seminars at several Italian universities,
with the possibility to interact with dynamic and talented researchers, to see
how laboratories were organised and set up across different departments.

It's nice to see how many brilliant researchers (and young investigators)
are working in our Universities.

This is the list of the places I could visit:

- University of Padua
- University of Turin
- University of Milan "Bicocca"
- University of Rome "Tor Vergata"
- University of Tuscia
- University of Viterbo
- University of Napoli "Federico II"

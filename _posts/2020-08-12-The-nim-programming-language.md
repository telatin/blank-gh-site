title: The Nim programming language for bioinformatics
---

I tried not to learn a new language and stick hard with Python, but in the end I failed.

I first heard of **nim** discovering [mosdepth](https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth), a fantastic program to extract coverage information from alignments. I just thought it was a bizarre choice and never thought again about it...

...until also [Heng Li blogged](https://lh3.github.io/2020/05/17/fast-high-level-programming-languages) about fast programming languages for bioinformatics.

My notes on the journey are available at:
